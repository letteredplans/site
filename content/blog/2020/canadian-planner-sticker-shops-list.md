Welcome back for another blog post!

I've done my best to compile a list of Canadian planner sticker shops. This came out of the video below, as most of you know, while I do like my stickers, a lot of the time I am on a no spend ðŸ˜¢.

In the past, a lot of shops I've purchased from were based in the US. However, as a Canadian, even though we are right next to the border, it does count as international shipping. As a result, shipping is way more expensive than (in my opinion) it should be.

So far, fortunately, I have not had to pay customs/ duties yet. However, espiecially with COVID-19, packages/ mail from the US have taken **way** longer to arrive, but at least with Canada Post, domestic mail *seems* to be working fine.

I still love my planner shops from the US and other shops, and will continue supporting them when I can as usual, but I also realized that I didn't really know/ have a good list of specifically Canadian planner sticker shops.

So, I made one!

If you want to help maintain the list, add your own shop, or add some shops, please [contact me](/about).
