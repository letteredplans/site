# About
**Hello! I'm Earnest, the person behind Lettered Plans.** I'm currently 16 and attending high school. [This is my personal site](https://earnestma.github.io/).

I share both my functional and memory planner spreads, bullet journal spreads, sometimes note-taking and study videos, stationery, vlogs, and more! While planning, I love listening to music, podcasts, and drinking tea.

My fave planners so far are:
- Leuchtturm 1917
- printpression weeks
- A6 Rings

Please [follow me](/quick-links) wherever you are, and I hope to see you around soon. Thanks for stopping by! ðŸ’—
